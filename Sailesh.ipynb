The last column is numeric, but as you will learn when you are coding binary categorical variables(can explain if you need just ask) we label them 1 and 0 typically.  Your professor gave you an entire column of 1.0, so i called it gender...Just Imagine 1.0 means everyone is a male in this dataset \n"

What the algoithm does, is it will look at how we can accurately classify each of these observations as either 1, -1 given Height weight and Gender.
